## React Friends

### Objectives
Learn the basics of React and see how its implementation compares to Angular.

___

### Step 1: Dependencies, file structure, and building.

Get started by cloning this repo and familiarizing yourself with the file structure.

```
react-friends/
-- dist/ /* this folder will contain all of the code we want available in the browser. */
---- index.html

-- src/ /* this folder will contain all of our pre-production code (code that hasn't yet been run through a build system). The majority of our work will happen here */
---- components/ /* React follows a component based architecture, this is the folder where we will be storing all of our components */
---- index.js /* This is the entry point of our application; the file to which everything will be connected */
---- styles.css

-- .babelrc /* We are using Babel alongside Webpack to compile our JSX/ES2015 into something browser-readable. This is where Babel is configured. */
-- webpack.config.js /* Webpack is the de facto build tool for React. A pre-built config has been provided but I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with it.
```

We'll start by using npm to install all of the dependencies necessary for our project. Don't forget to `npm init` before trying to install!

**Dev-Dependencies** ( `npm i --save-dev` )

* `webpack`
    * The module bundler we will be using as a build tool for this project.
    * If you haven't already, you will also want to install this globally ( `npm i webpack -g` )
* `webpack-dev-server`
    * A tool built for Webpack to allow live page reloads whenever a change is made.
    * If you haven't already, you will also want to install this globally ( `npm i webpack-dev-server -g` )
* `babel-core`
    * The core of Babel's parser
* `babel-preset-es2015`
    * A Babel preset allowing us to compile ES2015 to ES5
* `babel-preset-react`
    * A Babel preset allowing us to parse JSX
* `babel-loader`
    * Babel's Webpack plugin
* `style-loader`
* `css-loader`
    * These allow Webpack to handle our CSS as well as our JS

**Standard Dependencies** ( `npm i --save` )

* `react`
    * The core React library
* `react-dom`
    * The entry point of working with the DOM in React

**Checkpoint:** You should now be able to run `webpack-dev-server -d` and navigate a browser window to http://localhost:8080.

___

### Step 2: Components

Provided in `components.png` is an image breaking down the individual components of our application.

* Red - The wrapper component of our entire application
* Green - This component contains the friends list and search fields
* Yellow - Each individual friend will also be a component

We'll start in `index.js`, remember to check Webpack in your terminal for errors regularly!

* Start by importing React and ReactDOM, we'll need these to render our application into the DOM.
* Using ReactDOM's `render` method, render an `<h1>Hello from index.js!</h1>` onto the div with the id of `react-node`
    * Note that it is good practice to wrap this in a `document.addEventListener( "DOMContentLoaded", () => { //...` to ensure the application doesn't try to mount before the HTML document is ready.
* Import `styles.css` ( no need to save it to a variable ) so that Webpack will handle our styles as well.

**Checkpoint:** You should now be able to navigate to http://localhost:8080 and see a header with the text "Hello from index.js!". Your code should look something like this:

``` jsx
// index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import "./styles.css"

document.addEventListener( "DOMContentLoaded", () => {
	const reactNode = document.getElementById( "react-node" );

    if ( reactNode ) {
        ReactDOM.render(
            <h1>Hello from index.js!</h1>
            , reactNode )
    }
} );
```

Now that we are set up and rendering, we can start building our first component. Create a new file inside of the `components/` directory named `App.js` and open it up. This will be the root component of our application.

* Start by importing React ( we won't need ReactDOM here! )
* Next create a new class named `App` that inherits from `React.Component`.
* Create a `render` method on `App` that returns the following JSX:

``` jsx
<div>
    <h1>The <strong>facebook</strong> Friend Machine</h1>

    <div className="friends">

    </div>
</div>
```

* At the bottom of the page export `App` as the default export.
* Import `App` to `index.js` and replace our current `<h1>` with the App component.

**Checkpoint:** Your browser should now be displaying a styled header of "The **facebook** Friend Machine". The code should look something like this:

``` jsx
// index.js
 // ...
	if ( reactNode ) {
		ReactDOM.render(
			<App />
			, reactNode )
	}
} );
```

``` jsx
// App.js
import React from "react";

class App extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<h1>The <strong>facebook</strong> Friend Machine</h1>

				<div className="friends">

				</div>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default App;

```

___

With our header displaying and our app component ready for some child components, we can start building the next component: `FriendsList.js`

* Start by setting up `FriendsList.js` the same as `App` was; an exported class inheriting from `React.Component` with a `render` method that returns the following JSX:

```
<div>
	<form className="form-inline searchForm" role="form">
		<div className="form-group">

			<input className="form-control" placeholder="Search For Friends" />

            <select className="input-medium">
                <option>Name</option>
                <option>#Friends</option>
            </select>

            <select className="input-medium">
                <option>Descending</option>
                <option>Ascending</option>
            </select>

		</div>
	</form>

	<ul>
	</ul>
</div>
```

* This component will need internal state, which means it needs a `constructor`.
* The component's state should have three properties:
    * `searchText` - Initially an empty string
    * `orderBy` - Initially the string `"name"`
    * `order` - Initially the string `"ascending"`
* Assign the above sections of the component's state to the appropriate input and select fields.
* Add appropriate values to each option.

Your `FriendsList` class should now look something like this:

``` jsx
import React from "react";

class FriendsList extends React.Component {
	constructor( props ) {
	    super( props );

		this.state = {
			  searchText: ""
			, orderBy: "name"
			, order: "ascending"
		};
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<form
				    className="form-inline searchForm"
				    role="form"
                >
					<div className="form-group">

						<input
							className="form-control"
							placeholder="Search Anything For Friends"
							value={ this.state.searchText }
						/>

						<select
							className="input-medium"
							value={ this.state.orderBy }
						>
							<option value="name">Name</option>
							<option value="friend_count">#Friends</option>
						</select>

						<select
							className="input-medium"
							value={ this.state.order }
						>
							<option value="descending">Descending</option>
							<option value="ascending">Ascending</option>
						</select>

					</div>
				</form>

				<ul>
				</ul>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default FriendsList;

```

To test this component we'll need to import it into `App.js` and add the component inside of the div with the class of "friends". Because we haven't yet added an `onChange` handler none of these values are editable, so let's fix that!

* Begin by creating a new method on the `FriendsList` class named `handleChange`.
	* This method should take in two parameters, `field` and `event`.
	* When called, the method should use React's `setState` method to change the value of the correct property on state to `event.target.value`.
* Next we need to add `onChange` properties to our select and input elements, passing in our `handleChange` method.
	* Don't forget to use `bind` to preserve the context of `this`!
	* Make sure `onChange`'s `field` parameter matches the field on state that you want to change.


**Checkpoint:** You should now be able to make changes to your search field and select boxes and have that value placed on `FriendsList`'s `state`. Your code should look something like this:

``` jsx
import React from "react";

class FriendsList extends React.Component {
	constructor( props ) {
		super( props );

		this.state = {
			  searchText: ""
			, orderBy: "name"
			, order: "ascending"
		};
	}

	handleChange( field, event ) {
		this.setState( { [ field ]: event.target.value } );
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<form
					className="form-inline searchForm"
					role="form"
				>
					<div className="form-group">

						<input
							className="form-control"
							onChange={ this.handleChange.bind( this, "searchText" ) }
							placeholder="Search For Friends"
							value={ this.state.searchText }
						/>

						<select
							className="input-medium"
							onChange={ this.handleChange.bind( this, "orderBy" ) }
							value={ this.state.orderBy }
						>
							<option value="name">Name</option>
							<option value="friend_count">#Friends</option>
						</select>

						<select
							className="input-medium"
							onChange={ this.handleChange.bind( this, "order" ) }
							value={ this.state.order }
						>
							<option value={ "descending" }>Descending</option>
							<option value={ "ascending" }>Ascending</option>
						</select>

					</div>
				</form>

				<ul>
				</ul>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default FriendsList;
```

### Step 3: Friend Component, repeating, filtering.

Create a new file named `Friend.js` and follow the usual steps for creating a class with a render method that returns the following JSX:

``` jsx
<li className='friend'>
	<img className="profile-pic" src='http://placebear.com/50/50.jpg' />

		<h3>Cali Fornia</h3>

		<div className="location">
			Location: New Port Beach, California, United States
		</div>

		<div className="status">
			Status: I hate the snow. I wish I was on the beach right now!!! <span className="hashtag">#ihateprovo</span>
		</div>

		<div className="num-friends">
			Friends: 1,367
		</div>
</li>
```

* Import `Friend` into `FriendsList` and place it inside the `ul` tag at the bottom.
	* You should now see a single friend listed, but we want to display our whole list!
* First we need our data, import `friends.js` into `FriendList.js` and save it to a variable named `friends`.
* At the top of the render method `map` over the array of friends to create an array of `Friend` components, passing in `friend.name`, `friend.pic_square`, `friend.status`, `friend.friend_count`, and `friend.current_location` as props.
	* Don't forget that every repeated item in React needs a unique `key`. `friend.$$hashKey` would work well for this.
	* Be careful of null values!
* Adjust `Friend.js` to use `this.props` instead of the static data we included in our original JSX.

**Checkpoint:** You should now be displaying a large list of friends. Your code should look something like this:

``` jsx
// FriendsList.js
import React from "react";

import friends from "../../friends";

import Friend from "./Friend";

class FriendsList extends React.Component {

// ...
    render() {
		const friendsList = friends.map( friend => (
			<Friend
				currentLocation={ friend.current_location || {} }
				friendCount={ friend.friend_count }
				key={ friend.$$hashKey }
				name={ friend.name }
				pictureUrl={ friend.pic_square }
				status={ friend.status ? friend.status.message : "" }
			/>
		) );

        return (
            // ...
            <ul>
                { friendsList }
            </ul>
        );
    }
    // ...
```

``` jsx
// Friend.js
import React from "react";

class Friend extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<li className='friend'>
				<img className="profile-pic" src={ this.props.pictureUrl } />

					<h3>{ this.props.name }</h3>

					<div className="location">
						Location: { this.props.currentLocation.city }, { this.props.currentLocation.state }, { this.props.currentLocation.country }
					</div>

					<div className="status">
						{ this.props.status }
					</div>

					<div className="num-friends">
						{ this.props.friendCount }
					</div>
			</li>
		);
	}
}

export default Friend;
```

As the final touch, we need to add sorting and filtering. For this we will use plain JavaScript.

* Using the values we have stored on our FriendList component's state and built in array methods sort, filter, and reverse the array of Friend components as expected.
    * **Warning:** JavaScript's built in `.sort` does not reliably sort in Chrome. Either test in another browser or find a different sorting algorithm.
    * Your code should look something like this:

``` jsx
// FriendsList.js

// ...
const friendsList = friends
	.filter( friend => friend.name.toLowerCase().indexOf( this.state.searchText.toLowerCase() ) !== -1 )
	.sort( ( a, b ) => a[ this.state.orderBy ] > b[ this.state.orderBy ] ? 1 : -1 )
	.map( friend => (
		<Friend
			currentLocation={ friend.current_location || {} }
			friendCount={ friend.friend_count }
			key={ friend.$$hashKey }
			name={ friend.name }
			pictureUrl={ friend.pic_square }
			status={ friend.status ? friend.status.message : "" }
		/>
	) );

const displayFriends = this.state.order === "ascending" ? friendsList : friendsList.slice().reverse();

// ...
```

___

### Black Diamonds:

* Currently we are only searching by name. Create a select that allows users to choose what to search by.
* Update the UI so that Friend components without location data do not display two empty commas.
